# Code Complete 2 Notes
Notes based on reading Code Complete 2, by Steve McConnell

## Part I: Software Construction
* Verifying that the groundwork has been laid so that construction can proceed successfully
* Determining how your code will be tested
* Designing and writing classes and routines
* Creating and naming variables and named constants
* Selecting control structures and organizing blocks of statements
* Unit & integration testing and debugging your own code
* Reviewing low level designs and code of/with team members
* Carefully formatting and commenting code, even after it is written
* Integrating components that were built separately
* Tuning code to use fewer resources
* Prerequisite: Problem definition = clear statement of the problem your system is trying to solve

## Part II: Creating High Quality Code
* [Chapter 5: Design in Construction](chapter5.md)
* [Chapter 6: Working Classes](chapter6.md)
* [Chapter 7: High Quality Routines](chapter7.md)
